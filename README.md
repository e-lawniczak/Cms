# Cms
 
CMS for fictional pizzeria. Created during CMS course on Poznan University of Technology. The requirements were as professional as they coudl be in university environment. 
Together with my friend we created the CMS from scratch using .NET and React.
CMS allows user to log into the admin panel and change the elements of the site such as images, texts, titles etc.

The base for passing grade was documentation provided in polish - [docs](https://github.com/e-lawniczak/Cms/blob/main/CMS_docummentation.pdf)
